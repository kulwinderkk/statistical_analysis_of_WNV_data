## Statistics and Public Health : West Niles Virus (WNV Prevalence Data)

We have been provided with the mosquito tracking data from 2008 to 2019 for the city of Chicago. The city of Chicago, Illinois has been keeping track of mosquito populations and WNV prevalence using a series of traps that they place around the city.

West Nile Virus (WNV) is a viral illness largely spread by mosquitoes. The disease is transmitted to a person when an infected mosquito bites them.

They are then able to study the captured specimens and monitor the state of WNV spread in the city.

In these repository, I have uploaded two notebooks -
1. In [first](https://github.com/kulwinderkk/statistical_analysis_of_WNV_data/blob/main/Kulwinder_kaur_west_niles_virus_data_cleaning.ipynb), I have performed Data Cleaning and EDA.
2. In [second](https://github.com/kulwinderkk/statistical_analysis_of_WNV_data/blob/main/Kulwinder_Kaur_Deliverable_4_Final.ipynb), I have analysed the data to see the relationship between the different variables and the mosquito number, as well as the probability of finding West Nile Virus (WNV) at any particular time and location.
